We started with a simple idea: why should perfectly good products go to waste or sit unsold when people like you are out there looking for smart ways to save? We have made it our mission to source the highest quality open-box, overstocked, and scratch-and-dent products from the top brands - offering them to Canadians at up to 50% off. But we are not just about savings—we’re about changing how people shop. Say goodbye to paying full price and hello to smarter spending.

The Buyer Assistant role sits at the heart of SecondShop’s buying and merchandising engine. This is a hands-on, execution-heavy role designed for someone who is nearly ready to step into a full Buyer position and wants deeper exposure to vendor management, category performance, and commercial decision-making.
You will support day-to-day purchasing activity, manage supplier interactions, build and maintain purchase orders, and act as a key connector between Sales Operations, B2B, Supply Chain, and the Buying team.

Open-to-buy (OTB)
Proactively flag dead SKUs, margin leaks, overstocks, and gaps before issues escalate
Partner with Buyers to identify item needs and outreach strategies to suppliers
Internal Coordination & Communication
Act as the daily go-between for Sales Operations and the Buying team
Work closely with:
Supply Chain & Logistics
Inventory Planning
Pricing & Promotions
Marketing / E-commerce
Warehouse & DC Operations
Help resolve execution issues quickly by understanding ownership, impact, and next steps
Item & Data Integrity
Own SKU-level accuracy across:
Dimensions and weights
Case packs and pallet quantities
Compliance attributes (energy ratings, safety certifications, etc.)
Ensure item master data is accurate to prevent freight errors, listing issues, and operational failures
Promotional & Lifecycle Support
Support promotional deal setup and submissions
Provide inputs for flyers and digital content
Assist with line extensions, deletions, and end-of-life (EOL) planning
Help manage exit strategies for underperforming or obsolete inventory
Who We’re Looking For
3–5 years of experience working with vendors or suppliers
Industry background flexible
Analyst Merchandising / Buying Assistant progression strongly preferred
Almost ready to step into a Buyer role and eager to think like a merchant
Experience with big and bulky products is a strong asset
Highly organised, detail-oriented, and comfortable managing many moving parts simultaneously
Strong problem-solver who thrives in large, cross-functional team environments

What Sets You Apart

Exposure to real buying and merchandising decision-making
A clear development path toward a full Buyer role

INTERESTED IN DOING AN INTERNSHIP AT DUNSKY?

Accelerate the transition to a clean, low-carbon energy future

Dunsky Energy + Climate Advisors is a mission-driven firm (B-Corp certified) focused on helping our clients accelerate the transition to a clean, low-carbon energy future. We didn’t come to this lately: we’ve been at it for over 20 years – meticulously supporting leading governments, utilities, businesses and others across North America.

Our team of more than 60 professionals are whip-smart, kind, super-collaborative, fun, and deeply dedicated to our mission. They include a deep bench of analysts and subject matter experts (across buildings, energy, mobility, and industry), and a team of consultants able to translate findings and advise clients on the policies and strategies needed to make it happen. If you join us, you will help assess opportunities for large-scale decarbonization; design the programs, policies, and market strategies that can truly accelerate their adoption; and/or evaluate the performance of those strategies with a view to continuous improvement.

Of course, your success isn’t solely linked to impact. You want real an opportunity to grow – professionally and intellectually, and establish yourself in this field. We strive to offer all of this, because we know that your success is multifaceted.

IDEAL CANDIDATE

Our team is made up of collaborative, curious people who care deeply about the future of the planet. We are seeking an intern who shares these traits, and can conduct quantitative and qualitative research and analysis in clean energy solutions. We encourage you to apply if you are:
a recent graduate with a bachelor's or master’s degree in engineering (electrical, mechanical, chemical, etc.), applied science, economics, or another field of study that is relevant to renewable energy, building decarbonization, and clean mobility.
seeking a coop placement as part of a master’s degree in a relevant field of study and are nearing the end of your studies.

Required skills & experience:
strong problem-solving, quantitative analysis, and research skills
demonstrated interest in and knowledge of subjects related to the clean energy transition
adept at using the various tools within the MS Office suite, with a particular emphasis on Microsoft Excel skills (organizing data, solving analytical problems, visual presentation of results)
ability to write and communicate clearly in English*
ability to prioritize effectively and work on multiple tasks/projects within established timelines and budgets
effective presentation and verbal communication skills
ability to work in a team and strong interpersonal skills
demonstrated commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, through continuous development, modeling inclusive behaviors, and proactively managing bias

Preferred skills and experience:
work experience in the building science/engineering, renewable energy, energy utility operations, sustainable mobility or a related field
ability to write and communicate clearly in French
experience solving analytical problems with coding languages, such as Python or R
experience with data visualization with GIS, PowerBI, Tableau, or other commonly used tools

This position will involve constant and ongoing communication with employees and clients from across Canada and potentially beyond, including with individuals who may speak exclusively in English or (to a lesser degree) in French.

RESPONSIBILITIES

At Dunsky, interns will be involved in supporting our consulting projects by performing analysis and research. Interns will also work on special projects to support internal company objectives such as building new analytical tools, researching emerging technologies, or gathering a database of relevant data. These projects, as well as your responsibilities more generally, will be adapted based on your knowledge, expertise, and strengths.


WHY JOIN DUNSKY?

Be part of a firm that aligns with your values: As a mission-driven firm and a registered B Corp, our approach is driven by a deep respect for our team and a commitment to protect the planet.

Contribute your talents and skills to accelerate the clean energy transition: We work diligently at accelerating the transition to market adoption of clean energy solutions.

Work within a dynamic and welcoming team: We place a great deal of importance on offering our team the chance to grow and lead fulfilling lives. We believe that how we work together is as important as the work we do.

At Local Logic, our mission is to improve every real estate decision, from consumers seeking a neighborhood that aligns with their lifestyle to investors aiming to pinpoint the best locations for development, or local governments striving to build more sustainable cities through better urban planning.
We started our journey at McGill University’s urban planning department, where we came to see that cities were being developed in all kinds of unsustainable ways. Why were sprawling suburbs still being built, when doing so would increase pollution and inequality? Why were new business parks being built far from mass transit, when doing so would make traffic congestion skyrocket? Why was social housing being built in places that would exacerbate social problems rather than improve them?
It became clear to us why: cities are incredibly difficult to understand. But we realized that with recent advances in data science, all the complexity of cities could be made simple enough for anyone to understand. And that understanding would be essential to making the sustainable, equitable, and prosperous cities we desperately need.
Today, our extensive dataset of over 100 billion data points provides unparalleled insights and analytics that have influenced billions of dollars worth of real estate transactions and continuously help more than 22 million monthly users across 8,000 websites in the US and Canada make better-informed decisions.
In the summer of 2023, we secured a Series B funding round to grow our team, enhance our products, and, ultimately, help build the cities of tomorrow.
Your Mission
As Local Logic’s Marketing Coordinator, you will play a key support role on our marketing team. You will work across a variety of day-to-day marketing activities, including helping execute campaigns, supporting content and website updates, coordinating virtual and in-person events, managing marketing assets, and assisting with basic account-focused tasks. Reporting to the VP of Marketing, you will be involved in the hands-on work that keeps our marketing engine running smoothly.
This role is based in our Montreal office, where in-person collaboration is a core part of how we operate. While occasional remote days are possible when needed, we are looking for someone who thrives being on site with the team.
As Our Marketing Coordinator, Your Responsibilities Will Include:
Assisting in the execution of multi-channel marketing campaigns, including email, social media, digital ads, and events (digital & in-person).
Supporting content updates across our website, landing pages, and marketing materials.

Notre Mission
Chez Local Logic, notre mission est d'améliorer toutes les décisions immobilières, qu'il s'agisse des consommateurs à la recherche d'un quartier qui correspond à leur style de vie, des investisseurs qui cherchent à repérer les meilleurs emplacements à développer, ou des gouvernements locaux qui s'efforcent de construire des villes plus durables grâce à une meilleure planification urbaine.
Nous avons commencé notre parcours au département d'urbanisme de l'université McGill, où nous avons constaté que les villes se développaient de toutes sortes de manières non durables. Pourquoi continuer à construire des banlieues tentaculaires, alors que cela a pour effet d'accroître la pollution et les inégalités ? Pourquoi de nouvelles zones d'activités sont-elles construites loin des transports en commun, alors que cela fait exploser les embouteillages ? Pourquoi les logements sociaux sont-ils construits dans des endroits qui exacerbent les problèmes sociaux au lieu de les améliorer ?
Nous avons compris pourquoi : Les villes sont incroyablement difficiles à comprendre. Mais, nous avons réalisé qu'avec les progrès récents de la science des données, toute la complexité des villes peut être simplifiée pour que n'importe qui puisse la comprendre. Cette compréhension est essentielle pour créer des villes durables, équitables et prospères dont nous avons désespérément besoin.
Aujourd'hui, notre vaste ensemble de plus de 100 milliards de points de données fournit des informations et des analyses inégalées qui ont influencé des transactions immobilières d'une valeur de plusieurs milliards de dollars et qui aident en permanence plus de 15 millions d'utilisateurs mensuels, sur 8 000 sites web aux États-Unis et au Canada, à prendre des décisions plus éclairées.
Au cours de l'été 2023, nous avons obtenu un financement de série B afin d'agrandir notre équipe, d'améliorer nos produits et, en fin de compte, d'aider à construire les villes de demain.
